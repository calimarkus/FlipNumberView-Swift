# A SwiftUI FlipNumberView

A small universal (iOS + macOS) app displaying the current time with a flip animation.
This is still WIP and doesn't support everything, that the Obj-C + UIKit version (linked below) does. Nor does it even have a public API yet at all.

- Swift equivalent of [calimarkus/JDFlipNumberView](https://github.com/calimarkus/JDFlipNumberView).
- Originally based on [elpassion/FlipClock-SwiftUI](https://github.com/elpassion/FlipClock-SwiftUI).
